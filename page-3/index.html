        <h2>ADHD</h2>
        <p>ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking about what the result will be), or be overly active.</p>

        <h2>Open Your Mind</h2>
        <p>"Imagine having a paper that's due in two weeks. During the first week of the assignment, you tell yourself that you have time to complete it. As the week goes by, more work is added to your schedule because of other classes. The following week hits, and you plan to work on the project with three days left, along with the other work you have to do in different courses. Now you're staring at your hands in disgust because you know the procrastination leads to you having almost no time to finish your work."-ADHD(My ADHD)</p>
